Lidar-Lite-Breakout Task List:

SCHEMATIC

DONE - Reset pushbutton and IO pin to drive the ethernet reset.
	This is separate from the Atmega reset PB

DONE - Power only the microcontroller and related componets from the 
	USB when connected using two diodes. 

Fix title block description

DONE - Move 3.3v power LED next to power regulator. 

DONE - Status LED

DONE - ENABLED LEDs for each LIDAR

DONE - SDA AND SCL bus status LEDs using P-channel mosfets.

DONE - Fuse-blown LED using P-channel mosfet.

Come up with a standard LED for each functionality and make them varied (GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW, RED, WHITE).

Re-name LED name to LD1 instead of D1 (distinguish between non-lighting diodes)

Re-index components (primarily test points) aka Don't go TP1 then jump to TP12.

Make sure VCC1 and VCC2 are actually separate signals. The name of the symbol doesn't mean they are separated. (Probably just use a different symbol)

Space out the capacitors near the ATmega.

Write out information in full words (EX:SDA_STS -> SDA Status).

Make all labels the same size on the schematic.

Make the schematic origin the bottom left of the title block.

BOARD

Remove the hole from the Molex connector

Gather everything into a complete independant library. 

Manually route the board. 

Check via hole sizes.

Create actual mounting holes using the hole tool. 

Delete device names on the place layer and use the name layer. 

Delete old labels that no longer apply.

Check that traces can handle current, increase width if needed. 

Change out 5V power regulator and possibly 3.3V regulator?

Work on getting the powerpoint slides together for design review.

Clean up schematics to look nice.

RUN ELC AND DRC WHEN FINISHED ALL CHANGES!!! ASK ME (JOE) IF THINGS CAN BE APPROVED OR IGNORED.
