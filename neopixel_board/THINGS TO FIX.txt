Write DONE next to things that are finished

Schematic
---------

DONE - Name each NeoPixel data line something unique (NEO_1 etc.)

DONE - Switch the 1000 uF ceramic to electrolytic (because the ceramics don't exist)

Name components in order (Don't go from R1 to R5 for example. Click the ULP, then BOM to get list of components)

DONE - Add fuse to screw terminal input rated for whole board

Change LED names to LD1 instead of D1 (to distinguish from diodes)

Add BP capacitor to 3.3V micro controller

DONE - On the ethernet chip signals, say ETH_SCLK etc.

DONE - Use Ground symbol instead of tag

DONE - Add title block

Put the omega symbol for resistor value

Make all labels tags of a consistent size

DONE - Give reset pushbutton resistor a value

DONE - Use the same capacitor symbol for ceramic and a different but consistent capacitor symbol for electrolytic 

Replace USB micro with a different package that doesn't error out

Board
------

Place the rest of the components on the board

Shrink the dimensions of the board

Be mindful of current rating and route width
